# ProjectNode

ProjectNode allows you to easily organize ideas in a visual way and forces you to break down larger concepts. <br /><br />
You will create maps that are usually based off of one idea which you will then expand on. Just like the name states, each individual idea is held by a Node which can then be branched out with more related nodes. Each node can be edited and further description can be provided if necessary.
